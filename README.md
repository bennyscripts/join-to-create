# Join To Create
A Discord bot that creates a private voice channel when a member joins a voice channel.  
Inspired by Softwilly's Discord server bot which creates private rooms.

### Copyright
If you're planning to use this bot in your project then make sure to show the developers, Benny and Arty.  
There is already copyright in the bot itself so it would be great if you do not remove it.  

### How To Use
To use Join To Create, invite the bot with the below link then run `!setup` for a list of setup commands, you must be admin to run the commands! For regular users, if you have a current voice channel then you can run `!vc` for commands.  
- Invite: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=838084070986350642&permissions=8&scope=bot

If you would like to add the bot to your project then download the code as a zip and add the commands from the bot into your bot, soon we are planning on converting everything into cogs for easier addition to personal projects.
